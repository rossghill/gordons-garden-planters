            <p>Welcome to Gordon's Garden Planters.</p>

            <p>We are a local business based just outside the village of Cleish in South Kinross-shire and can offer a local delivery service if required.</p>

            <p>I have always enjoyed woodworking so after my retirement in 2021, I got a garden workshop built and started designing and making garden planters to keep me occupied with a hobby I very much enjoy.</p>

            <p>Maureen, my wife, takes care of the marketing and sales side of things for me. If you have any questions or requests please contact her directly and she will assist you.</p>

            <p>There are a selection of sizes and designs that can be viewed on the website along with prices for each. I can also offer a "made to measure" service to suit customer requirements if different sizes or designs are preferred.</p>

            <p>We can also make window boxes and fence planters for those with smaller gardens or who live in flats.</p>
