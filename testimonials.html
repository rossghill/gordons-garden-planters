                <p>We decided to contact Gordon after receiving the brochure for Gordon's Garden Planters.<br />
                    Gordon and Maureen were most accommodating when we visited to view their products.<br />
                    We ordered a number of various designs ( to my knowledge unavailable from mainstream outlets ) and they were constructed and delivered within a week.<br />
                    We are delighted with our beautiful planters and would not hesitate to recommend Gordon's Garden Planters.<br />
                    
                    p.s. " tip " A couple of coats of Cuprinol Garden Furniture Stain brings out the true beauty of the wood.<br />

                    I originally saw Gordon's gorgeous planters on Facebook and contacted him about a trough. I arranged to go and see it and Gordon and his wife Maureen gave me a lovely welcome. Gordon showed me his workshop and I've already got my eye on more pieces!<br />
                    The trough is made from very sturdy, tanalised wood and the workmanship is of very high quality with great attention to detail. I love the designs too. <br />
                    Unexpectedly, I was delighted to be given a freebie too and Gordon insisted on carrying it through and putting it in my car for me. <br />
                    Both Gordon and Maureen are a really lovely couple and I would highly recommend both their fabulous service and beautiful products.<br />
